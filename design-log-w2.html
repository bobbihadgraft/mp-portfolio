              <p>I was informed of the coding technique which allows me to link pages needed for the different elements of my assignment. I also experimented with text colour by editing the CSS. In photography we explored different genres to help us inform our own project themes.</p>
              <h2 class="section-heading">How will I implement this learning into my final portfolio?</h2>
                      <p>I have been able to integrate multiple linked pages so that I have a page for each element of media production. Changing font colours will allow me to create a set style for my website to complement my content. The exploration of photographic themes will help me to clarify my work objectives.</p>

                  <p>I learnt how to insert images by using Unsplash’s royalty free images as placeholders for my own images. In photography, I was informed of Photoshop basics such as adjusting saturation and contrast, as well as the differences between RAW and JPEG files.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">How will I implement this learning into my final portfolio?</h2>
                          <p>I will be able to insert placeholder images, as well as my own images once I have completed my series of photographs later on. I will be able to select the appropriate file types for these and edit them with awareness.</p>

                    <p>I read the dealing with files, HTML and CSS basics guides and gained understanding of the anatomy of my coding. I have taken notes of the main information gaps that I have filled, as well as setting a plan of action for my own site.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How will I implement this learning into my final portfolio?</h2>
                            <p>I will ensure to use the information to continue to adapt my own site, for example, changing the paragraph text colour by identifying the paragraph element CSS.</p>

                      <p>I selected and downloaded a royalty free image from Unsplash which fit the theme I was hoping to pursue in photography. I was then advised to use “Material Design” to acquire colours to complement the theme. I also made changes to the CSS, informed by the guide read on Wednesday. In photography I pursued a shoot off-site to exercise taught techniques.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">How will I implement this learning into my final portfolio?</h2>
                              <p>I will be able to shape and adapt the style of my site as I create my own content and theme it around the tones and ideas portrayed, such as including more greys to create a sense of pathetic fallacy if my images are captured in more overcast weather. The test shoot will allow me to identify strengths as well as areas I need to improve on in photography.</p>

                        <p>I researched how to change font sizes in order to start eliminating widows within my typography and made final tweaks before submitting my prototype website. I also began to change some of the placeholder text so as to indicate what content will fill each space.</p>

                                <p>I will be able to use this as a comparison to see how much progress I have made by the end of the module. It will allow me to reflect on my learning of web design and development.</p>
