              <p>I was introduced to web design, the difference between web designers and developers and researched styles and themes as inspiration for my own site. In photography, I became familiar with the equipment we will be using.</p>
              <h2 class="section-heading">How will I implement this learning into my final portfolio?</h2>
                      <p>I can use the examples to inform my own website. Within photography, familiarity with the camera will assist me in my work later on, so I am able to use the equipment to its full potential.</p>

                  <p>I used Github and gained information on its purpose and how to use it alongside Atom. This included pushing some of my first websites amendments to origin. In photography I was introduced to and advised how to pursue photographic techniques such as leading lines and fill the frame.</p>

                          <p>I will need to use Github and Atom throughout the development of my website, therefore I will need to keep experimenting and practising so as to be confident using it. In photography, I can use the techniques to vary my own photography and make my images increasingly striking and powerful.</p>

                    <p>I read the Dieter Rams Design Principles to explore design theory which will provide ideas for my own site. I then researched examples of existing apps and webpages which demonstrated Rams’ principles, such as UBER Sign Language, which exercises “good design is as little design as possible”.</p>

                            <p>I will use this theory to advise my own website so as to achieve a webpage that is striking and presents clarity for users. </p>

                      <p>I was taught about Information Architecture’ and was able to sketch out a hierarchical sitemap of my website. This will allow me to advise my content structure later on. For photography, I researched editing techniques such as colour popping to add impact.</p>

                        <p>I learnt about the essentials of typography and different key words of its practice, such as kerning, tracking and the difference between serif and sans-serif. In photography we explored implementing different techniques by adjusting the exposure triangle.</p>

                                <p>I will be able to use typography theories to ensure my website is easy to read and well displayed. In photography the ability to change settings and create effects by how I use the camera will increase the quality of my final pieces.</p>
